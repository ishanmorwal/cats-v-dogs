# cats-v-dogs #
This repository contains my cats-v-dogs model, that I first came to know of in my Tensorflow's Image Classification Course.
It makes use of TensorFlow's Keras, along with the dataset made available by Kaggle. 

# How does it work? #
Simply put, modern neural networks, especially the ones made using implements like Keras, do feature recognition really well. Let's say a model has been trained on random images of cats and dogs, it will recognize the features and classify those features to an attribute of either a 'cat' or a 'dog'. Keep in mind that the model made by me here is quite rudimentary, classification of the young ones gets harder as their features only become easy to differentiate when they get older. All in all, this was my first taste of any machine learning ever, and It was fun.
